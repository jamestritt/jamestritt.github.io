            <h1 class="title">LEAN TECHNOLOGY SERVICES</h1>
            <p class="bodyCopy">At Gatekey℠, we consider Lean Technology to be composed of three subsections. These subsections, Lean Manufacturing, Lean Office, and Lean Management, focus upon different areas of an organization. In a complete Lean transformation all are addressed, but often, organizations begin the process in one area. Frequently, the transformation begins with Lean Manufacturing in the production environment where results can be typically achieved rapidly and can be observed by all. For those organizations that provide a service to their customers, Lean Office is the approach that yields improvements. Once improvements are delivered that impact the output of an organization, Lean Management is an approach that improves the overall capability of an organization to monitor and sustain improvements.</p>
            <p class="bodyCopy">All the Lean subsections employ specific techniques designed to analyze the current situation and provide the information necessary to improve productivity. These techniques (or tools) allow client personnel to understand the process and achieve results. A brief description of the subsections and techniques is listed as follows:</p>

Our consultants bring knowledge and experience gained from various industries, and apply them to the situation at new client companies.</p>
